**Austin, TX – January 2020** –  [Zollege Public Benefit Corporation](https://zollege.com/ "Zollege Public Benefit Corporation") has announced the acquisition of [Austin Coding Academy](https://austincodingacademy.com/ "Austin Coding Academy"), one of the largest coding bootcamps in the state of Texas and a leader in technology education. Austin Coding Academy currently serves over 200 students in Austin and Lubbock ([Lubbock Coding Academy](https://lubbockcodingacademy.com/ "Lubbock Coding Academy")), providing practical and accessible technical training in software development, as well as partnering with universities and companies to source tech talent and create innovative training solutions to help build a stronger workforce.

Austin Coding Academy and Zollege share the same passion - debt free education. They believe an education in web development should be accessible to any and everyone who wants to learn. Beginning in the spring, in addition to Austin and Lubbock Coding Academies, new schools across Texas will open with the name, Circle Coding Academy. [Circle Coding Academy](https://circlecoding.com/ "Circle Coding Academy") will host its first cohort in Dallas beginning on April 13, 2020, at the Centrl Office Downtown location.

Another school under the Zollege umbrella is, [Vandelay Education](https://www.vandelayeducation.com/ "Vandelay Education"). Vandelay’s mission is to lead the change in the for-profit certificate market, so that the majority of certificate students will begin their career with zero federal financial aid and minimal debt. They have over 100 dental and medical schools across the nation that practice this mission.

The Circle Coding Academy brand, and its parent, Circle Education, will join Vandelay Education as part of Zollege PBC, operating under the chartered mission of ending student debt and training the future workforce through innovative technical education. With the support of Zollege PBC, Circle Education will pursue national expansion through additional coding bootcamps, to be named “[Circle Coding Academy](https://circlecoding.com/ "Circle Coding Academy")”, K-12 after-school and summer programs, to be named “[Early Code](https://earlycode.com/ "Early Code")”, and through continued strategic partnerships with public and private entities aimed at increasing access to tech and creating innovative training solutions.

Locations:

**Zollege HQ** - home of the offices for Austin Coding Academy, Circle Education, and Vandelay Education

1335 E. Whitestone Blvd.

Suite W-100

Cedar Park, TX 78613

Both Austin Coding Academy and Lubbock Coding Academy will continue to operate normally in their respective cities, with classes continuing to be held at both Austin Coding Academy - Highland and Austin Coding Academy - Capital Factory in Austin and at the South Plains College Lubbock Center in Lubbock. Leadership at Austin Coding Academy will remain unchanged.
