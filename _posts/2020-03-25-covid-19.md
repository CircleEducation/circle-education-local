Response to the COVID-19 Crisis

We are committed to providing effective education for our students in a safe environment. Therefore, we will follow all of CDC’s recommendations and begin temporarily conducting our classes in an online format in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

For now, students will receive the same great education that leads to jobs via our online classrooms with instructors and classmates joining from their computers and phones. Students will watch lectures, ask questions, collaborate, and receive support and guidance from our highly experienced instructors.

We will resume in person classes once we hear from the CDC and government officials that it is safe.

Fortunately, web development is a field that comes with many possible opportunities to work remotely. If you are ready for a career change, or want to learn more, click here: [Apply Now](/apply/ "Apply Now")

If you have any concerns or further questions, we are happy to help. Our admissions team is available Monday through Friday 8am - 5pm CST by phone and email. Together we can overcome this crisis, and our students will continue to prepare and launch their new careers.
