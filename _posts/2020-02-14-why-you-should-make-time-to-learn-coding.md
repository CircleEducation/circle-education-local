Use this guide to explore the field, the job opportunities associated, and offerings within Circle Coding Academy's program:

## Opportunities After Bootcamp

Web Development is an all-encompassing term that focuses on the development of websites and web applications. Jobs may include web-based internet applications, social networking platforms, and electronic business platforms. Individuals trained in this field may work in web content development, web engineering, cybersecurity, or design. This training could also lead to the development of CRM systems, still considered a new branch of web development.

In this day and age, virtually every business and individual contractor needs a website and payment platform to operate. This means more jobs for individuals like you.

**Market Growth**: “The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm) projects about 13 percent employment growth for web developers by 2026. During that period, about **21,300 new jobs** will need to be filled in an industry that already **has roughly 162,900 positions**.”

**Web Developer**: **Web developers**, also called **web** designers or webmasters, design and maintain websites. You might design and develop basic website layout or advanced interactive website features.

**Web Engineer**: **Web** application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. **Web engineering** focuses on the specifics of application development that apply to websites and their offsets.

## Learning Web Development Can Boost Your Career

**Web Development has one of the highest job opening rates in the world.** [**Forbes**](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mjd45eilkk/web-development/#7864f8833180) published an article celebrating Web Development as one of the top freelance careers, with freelancers earning an average of $36 to $40 an hour.

[**Some articles**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/10/five-reasons-why-web-development-is-a-better-career-path-than-machine-learning/#378689f53ddf) have even claimed that learning Web Development is more valuable than learning Machine Learning for a few reasons: There are countless jobs, it is a simple and straightforward working process, it is creative and fun, and is also extremely lucrative. This linear career path makes room for learning new working systems and trends, while also leaving space for creative liberty and thought.
