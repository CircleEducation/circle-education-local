We had the opportunity to sit down with Austin Coding Academy alumnus, Seth, and talk about his coding journey.  He is a User Experience Developer at Indeed! He shared some insider tips and tricks for prospective and current students.

4. How did you hear about ACA?

   **Google**
5. What inspired you to take the leap from graphic design to web development?

   **I wanted to be involved in every process of a project. I was already proficient in HTML and CSS, so I wanted to take it a step further and dive into JavaScript.**

7. What is the best perk?

   **I feel like I am finally getting paid my worth.**
8. What advice do you have to prospective and/or current ACA students?
