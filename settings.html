    bio: As a humble hustler, I’ve grown with Circle Coding Academy over the last
      three years holding several roles wherever I could add value to the school and
      to the students. I graduated with a Journalism BS from University of Richmond
      (go Spiders!), and got my professional start with sales and leadership. I’ve
      traveled coast-to-coast on my motorcycle several times, which led me to find
      a true home in Texas since 2014. I’m all about connecting, so say hello!
