blurb: I've worked an assortment of dead-end jobs that paid the bills, but only just. Coding always seemed like a dream that was out of reach until I heard of Austin Coding Academy. I decided to take the leap and do what I've always wanted to do. This program opened my eyes to the possibilities that open up when learning all of these different programing languages. Thats why I plan on continue my education on the side so I can become an expert in coding. I would never have had the confidence to do that if it wasn't for this program. I'm excited for the future."
