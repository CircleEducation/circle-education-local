projects:

  - name: DD Agency
    desc: DD is an enrollment marketing technology agency that helps the Davids of the education space beat their Goliaths. They are the only HubSpot Platinum Partner Agency that exclusively serves the enrollment management space and to reflect that, they needed a change. A website that conveyed experience and quality, but that also seemed approachable and fast. In partnership with an amazing designer, I built this entire website from the ground up. Fully customized to meet the company's needs and to give everyone who visits a fun, clean, and insightful experience that drives high quality conversions.

  - name: DD Studio
    desc: As the media production arm of DD, they needed a website that screamed cutting-edge marketing and authentic storytelling, with the goal of helping their clients reach their audiences and drive them to action. With that in mind, I created a beautiful website that included fun experiences, video samples, hidden easter eggs, and effortless conversion pathways so any new visitors would know exactly what they were getting and how great the DD Studio team is.

  - name: Bard College
    desc: Change Minds. Change the Rules. Change the Game. This is what Bard College stands for, and their Graduate Programs in Sustainability are helping lead the charge in environmental education. However, their website was not turning the heads it needed to. That's where I came in. I was able to provide them with a beautiful user experience that impressed their users with a feeling of sophistication, leadership, and care. With tons of opportunities to learn more about their programs and even get started without the degree.

  - name: Friends Academy
    desc: At Friends Academy, they achieve educational excellence by committing to the highest standards of learning and living. That's what they want, not just for their students, but for their faculty, staff, alumni, and families; and that's what they wanted to convey with their website. That their school is place to take whats already inside and to let it shine. In conjunction with a wonderful team of designers, we created an experience that didn't stress, but embraced the small things. A fully customized website that gave the client every inch of what they wanted in more.

  - name: Simple Technology Solutions
    desc: Simple Technology is on the cutting edge of Cloud computing, providing their customers with high quality, scalable solutions. But while they were winning awards with their services... let's just say their website wasn't following suit. So I came in and tore it all down, just so I could build it up bigger and better than before. Showing in a clean and digestible way, all of their services, resources, thought leadership, and of course their many awards.

  - name: DD Academy
    desc: DD Academy is an initiative I started to help educate the entire enrollment marketing team with video tutorials on strategy, technology, and creativity. Everyone from the admissions counselor to a graphic designer, a web developer or the director of marketing, this content was made for them all. Not only did I design and build this website myself, but I also write and star in all of our videos, produced with the help of an incredible video production specialist.
