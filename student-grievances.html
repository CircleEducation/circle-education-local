title: Student Grievance Policy
policy_paragraphs:
- It is the schoolâ€™s policy to resolve student grievances by working directly with
  the student, instructor, and other students if affected. Students with grievances
  should initially contact their instructor and articulate their grievance in writing.
  The instructor will notify the Director of Student Services of student grievance
  and attempt to resolve the grievance.
- Attempts to resolve the grievance will be documented in email by the instructor
  and copied to the Director of Student Services. If the instructor and student are
  unable to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be escalated to the Director
  of Student Services. The Director of Student Services will review prior resolution
  documentation, identify student concerns, needs, desires, and attempt to resolve
  the grievance with the student. The Director of Services will document this process
  in writing in a student report file.
- If the Director of Student Services is unable to resolve the student grievance,
  the Director of Student Services will convene a committee of 2 student peers, 2
  other certified instructors, and the Director of Student Services to resolve the
  student grievance. The committee will review articulated grievance and documented
  attempts to resolve and form a majority decision for grievance resolution and present
  to student for approval. The Director of Student Services will document their resolution
  in the student report file.
