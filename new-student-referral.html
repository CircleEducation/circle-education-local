    they each share one common trait; every CCA student is committed to learning and
    improving, whether they’re hoping to launch a more rewarding career, adding a
    new skill to their repertoire, or transforming a great idea into a new company.
    The best way to grow Circle Coding Academy and continue to make sure that people
    have access to an affordable and practical software development education is by spreading
    the word.

  - question: How Does It Work?
    text: Circle Coding Academy’s referral process is simple. Current students, graduates,
      and instructors who want to share the benefits of learning with CCA will be
      rewarded for growing the community. CCA will be awarding referral bonuses to
      both current students, grads, and instructors who refer new students and also
      to referred students who enroll in classes. Both the new student and the referring
      student, graduate, or instructor will receive a $250 Amazon gift card for helping
      build our community. Simply enter your information at the bottom of this page
      and document which current Circle Coding Academy student, staff, or instructor
      referred you to the program. Once you apply, make sure to mention that you are
      taking advantage of the student referral program.
  - question: Who Should I Refer?
    text: Know someone else who is committed to improvement? Maybe a friend, family
      member, or coworker who is looking for a career change or to add a new set of
      skills to their current job? Don’t be shy, let them know about our program.
      Circle Coding Academy is here to help people who are looking to improve their
      lives. We’re proud of how strong our community is, so adding someone who shares
      our values makes all of us better.
  - question: Why Should I Refer Someone?
    text: Referrals help keep the CCA community growing, and it’s always extra rewarding
      to help someone you care about succeed. By referring someone to CCA, you’re
      giving that person the opportunity to improve their lives by gaining valuable
      and in-demand skills. It’s exciting to see friends and family members work together
      in our program and strive towards making meaningful changes in their careers,
      together. Let’s keep that up!

  description: Students at Austin Coding Academy come from all walks of life, but
    they each share one common trait; every ACA student is committed to learning and
    improving, whether they’re hoping to launch a more rewarding career, adding a
    new skill to their repertoire, or transforming a great idea into a new company.
    After our students complete ACA and witness first-hand the transformative nature
    of our school, they’re so often shouting our praises from the rooftop. As a way
    of saying thanks for all of that ACA love, we’re offering a special Referral Program
    for our January and February cohorts!

    text: Austin Coding Academy’s referral process is simple. Current students, graduates,
      and instructors who want to share the benefits of learning with ACA will be
      rewarded for growing the community. ACA will be awarding referral bonuses to
      both current students, grads, and instructors who refer new students, and to
      referred students who enroll in classes. Both the new student and the referring
      student, graduate, or instructor will receive $250 for helping build our community.
      When a referred student submits an application they’ll select either "ACA faculty
      / staff" or "ACA student / alumni" in the "How did you hear about us?" field.
      Be sure to mention who you were referred by in your application interview. Once
      the new student has the full Web 101 course, both the student and the referrer
      will receive their reward... Easy!
